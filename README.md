H2O - an optimized HTTP server / library implementation
===

H2O is an optimized server implementation with support for HTTP/1, HTTP/2, websocket running either on TCP or TLS (i.e. HTTPS and WSS).

It uses libuv as it's backend, but a tiny event loop is also provided in case speed / code footprint is important.
